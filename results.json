    "abstract": "Retrospective Cohort. Spinal fusions are common interventions for degenerative spine disease (DSD), with increasing utilization in obese and metabolic syndrome populations. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA), widely adopted for diabetes and weight management, may offer systemic benefits that exert a parallel influence on surgical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate whether preoperative GLP-1 RA use influences 90-day medical and 2- and 10-year surgical complications following thoracic and/or lumbar spinal fusion for DSD, stratified by BMI. Using a national claims database (2010-2023), we identified patients undergoing thoracic and/or lumbar spinal fusion for degenerative conditions. GLP-1 RA users within 6 months pre-op were 4:1 matched to controls by age, sex, and CCI across six BMI strata. Outcomes included 90-day medical and 2- and 10-year surgical complications (e.g., revisions for infection, pseudoarthrosis, and mechanical failure). Chi-square, t-tests, and Cox models were used for statistical analysis. Among 291,677 patients, 19,232 GLP-1 RA users were matched to 76,778 controls. Ninety-day medical complications-such as infection, pneumonia, thromboembolism, sepsis, stroke, and UTI-were significantly reduced in GLP-1 RA users across BMI categories \u226525. Two-year surgical complications were lower among GLP-1 RA users in BMI 35-39.9 (1.1% vs. 1.6%, P=0.007 for pseudarthrosis-related revision; 0.8% vs. 1.2%, P=0.038 for mechanical failure) and \u226540 groups. At 10 years, GLP-1 RA use was associated with significantly reduced risk of revision in the 25.0-29.9 (HR 0.79, P=0.046) BMI group. Revision due to pseudarthrosis was reduced in BMI 35.0-39.9 (HR 0.69, P=0.014) and \u226540.0 (HR 0.73, P=0.041), while revision for mechanical failure was lower in BMI 35.0-39.9 (HR 0.65, P=0.013) and \u226540.0 (HR 0.57, P=0.003). GLP-1 RA use was linked with reduced perioperative and long-term surgical complications in patients undergoing thoracic and/or lumbar fusions for degenerative spine disease, particularly in those with BMI \u226525. This risk reduction may be attributed to weight loss and/or the systemic metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular benefits of these medications.",

We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes after EVT between young and older patients. Using a multicenter retrospective registry, we analyzed patients undergoing EVT for acute VBAO. Patients were dichotomized by age (18-44\u2009years vs\u2009\u2265\u200945\u2009years). Primary outcomes were functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, mRS 0-2) at 90\u2009days and 1\u2009year. Secondary outcomes included successful reperfusion, 24-hour/discharge National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, early neurological function changes, 90-day/1-year mRS distributions, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for confounders assessed associations. Interaction effects between age group and hypertension/diabetes/atrial fibrillation were evaluated. Among 518 patients, 37 (7.1%) were aged 18-44\u2009years. Young patients had fewer cardiovascular comorbidities. Etiologies were more heterogeneous in young patients (large-artery atherosclerosis: 35.1%, other determined cause: 35.1%). Young patients more frequently achieved early neurological improvement and functional independence at 90\u2009days and 1\u2009year (unadjusted). Adjusted analyses showed age dichotomization was not significantly associated with 90-day (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.50-2.64, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.74) or 1-year (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 0.68-3.72, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.286) functional independence. A significant hypertension-by-age interaction existed for 90-day functional independence (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.014), and no significant interactions were found for other comorbidities or at 1\u2009year. Mortality and sICH rates were comparable between the two groups. EVT demonstrates comparable efficacy in young and older VBAO patients, underscoring its critical value especially for young patients with more heterogeneous etiologies.",

Previous systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have evaluated the effectiveness of MOV in the general population; however, evidence on high-risk population is lacking. This SLR assessed the real-world effectiveness of MOV for reducing the progression to severe COVID-19 outcomes in clinical settings, including high-risk or special populations (such as patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, immunocompromised conditions, older adults, and nursing home residents) who have limited alternative COVID-19 treatment options. We searched EMBASE and PubMed databases for studies published between January 1, 2021-May 24, 2024, using predefined search terms related to MOV. Studies comparing MOV-treated with untreated groups of non-hospitalized adults at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization, death, and the composite of hospitalization/death) were included. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Twenty-one general and special population studies were included. General population studies (n\u2009=\u200916) showed that MOV reduced the risk of death, hospitalization, and hospitalization/death. Special population studies (n\u2009=\u200910; five additional and five general population articles with subgroups of interest) also showed that MOV reduced the risk of the same outcomes, with a more pronounced effect in older adults (\u226560 years). The wide range of risk reduction observed might be attributed to variability in COVID-19 hospitalization guidelines and vaccination status. Findings from this SLR suggest that MOV may reduce the risk of hospitalization, death, and hospitalization/death compared with untreated groups, including high-risk adults with underlying comorbidities. Further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of MOV in high-risk or special populations.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong association between vascular risk factors, particularly in midlife, and stroke risk; therefore, the co-occurrence of multiple risk factors may be especially informative. This study used a machine-learning-based cluster analysis to group individuals into clusters based on similar clinical profiles in midlife and assessed the clusters' associations with stroke risk and severity. Participants (N=15\u2009404) without prevalent stroke from the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) were included. An unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach was used to allocate participants into clusters based on the presence of clinical risk factors in midlife: hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal dysfunction, and peripheral artery disease. Clusters were then characterized by their defining features. In Cox proportional hazard models, the association of the clusters with overall stroke incidence (and with ischemic stroke incidence stratified by stroke severity) was tested. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the association of morbidity clusters with outcomes of no stroke, stroke before the age of 70 years, and stroke at age of \u226570 years. Of 1424 incident ischemic strokes diagnosed from baseline (1987-1989) to December 31, 2020, 1104 included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) grading (minor-mild stroke: NIHSS score \u22645 [n=687]; moderate-severe stroke: NIHSS score >5 [n=417]). The cluster analysis identified 9 distinct clusters in the population with defining features: cluster 1 (relatively healthy); cluster 2 (smoking); cluster 3 (cancer); cluster 4 (peripheral artery disease); cluster 5 (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia); cluster 6 (coronary heart disease); cluster 7 (atrial fibrillation); cluster 8 (heart failure); and cluster 9 (renal dysfunction). Compared with cluster 1, clusters 2 to 9 were each associated with a greater stroke risk, with the largest effect estimate for cluster 9 (hazard ratio, 3.00 [95% CI, 2.00-4.50]). The association with moderate-severe stroke incidence (versus no stroke) was also strongest for cluster 9 (hazard ratio, 4.78 [95% CI, 2.62-8.74]). Except for cluster 5 (which was associated with stroke at any age), all midlife morbidity clusters were associated with greater stroke risk before the age of 70 years but not after the age of 70 years. The findings emphasize the importance of morbidity clusters in midlife for stroke incidence and severity.",

    "abstract": "The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 allele and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are independent risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. The T2DM patients carrying the ApoE \u03b54 allele exhibit heightened activation of platelet glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), a key downstream kinase in the insulin signaling pathway, along with more severe cognitive deficits. This observation suggests an intrinsic link between ApoE \u03b54, GSK-3\u03b2, and cognitive dysfunction. However, the precise mechanisms by which ApoE \u03b54 influences GSK-3\u03b2 activity and exacerbates brain pathology and cognitive decline in T2DM patients remain poorly understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed T2DM mouse models by generating humanized ApoE \u03b53/\u03b53 and \u03b54/\u03b54 knock-in mice. The mice were subjected to a high-fat diet combined with multiple low-dose intraperitoneal streptozotocin injections to induce T2DM. We then assessed GSK-3\u03b2 expression, AD-like pathologies, and cognitive functions in these models. We observed that GSK-3\u03b2 activity was significantly upregulated in ApoE4 mice, accompanied by disruption of the insulin signaling pathway. Notably, ApoE4-T2DM mice exhibited exacerbated AD-related pathologies, including increased accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, neuroinflammation, and synaptic loss. These changes were correlated with more severe cognitive impairments compared with ApoE3-T2DM or ApoE4 mice. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 activity using the selective inhibitor 9-ING-41 effectively ameliorated both AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits in ApoE4-T2DM mice. Our findings suggest that ApoE4 exacerbates AD pathogenesis by activating GSK-3\u03b2. Furthermore, targeting GSK-3\u03b2 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to halt the progression from T2DM to AD, providing new insights into potential interventions for patients at risk.",

This nationwide retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy on dyslipidemia and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in CHB patients. Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database, we identified 441\u2009191 patients, of whom 48\u2009606 received antiviral treatment and were matched 1:1 with untreated controls by propensity score. Antiviral therapy was associated with significantly lower incidence rates of both dyslipidemia (14.63 vs. 18.20 per 100\u2009000 person-years; IRR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76-0.85) and MACE (2.15 vs. 3.08 per 100\u2009000 person-years; IRR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) showed the strongest protective effects against both outcomes, with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.52 for dyslipidemia and 0.58 for MACE. Stratified analysis revealed that the protective effects of antiviral therapy against dyslipidemia and MACE were primarily observed in nondiabetic patients, while only a nonsignificant trend toward risk reduction was noted in diabetic patients. These findings suggest that antiviral therapy, particularly TDF, provides extrahepatic benefits, supporting its role in the long-term management of CHB beyond virologic suppression.",

However, the potential concern about its sodium load has not been fully investigated. In this study, we evaluated the association between SPS initiation and heart failure (HF), compared with calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS). This retrospective study enrolled individuals from a nationwide claims database who had been newly prescribed either SPS or CPS between April 2014 and August 2023. The incidence of HF between the two groups was compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the propensity scores. We analysed 3481 eligible individuals, of whom 478 received SPS and 3003 CPS. Median age (interquartile range) was 78 (71-83) years, 2160 (62%) were male, and median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 47.0 (32.1-63.1) mL/min/1.73\u2009m<sup>2</sup>. Over a median follow-up of 361 (147-726) days, 709 HF events were documented. Weighted Cox regression analysis demonstrated that SPS users had a higher risk of developing HF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.53). In sub-group analyses, the association of SPS administration with incident HF was more profound in individuals aged \u2265\u200978\u2009years (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.05-1.79) than in those aged <\u200978\u2009years (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.69-1.48). Our analysis of a nationwide real-world dataset demonstrated that the use of SPS was associated with an increased likelihood of developing HF, suggesting a possible risk related to SPS-induced sodium loading.",

These individuals were usually housed in private residences or residential facilities and were displaced by the disaster. The operational model was to gather the target population in a temporary facility, assess the needs of each individual and accompanying caretakers, provide health care and social support, and plan a discharge to either an intermediate facility or return to their original residence, if conditions became appropriate. RDF PHS-1 developed approaches for assessment, tracking, planning, resource utilization, and decision making that were field tested, refined them, and then validated their utility.

CST decreased from 332.3\u00a0\u00b5m to 267.0\u00a0\u00b5m (p = 0.069), and BCVA remained stable (0.49 to 0.55 logMAR, p = 0.2081). Complete macular fluid resolution occurred in 87.5% of eyes, with a median resolution time of 6 months. Recurrence occurred in 37.5% of eyes during follow-up, with a median time to recurrence of 9 months. Among eyes on fixed dosing (n = 11), 72.7% achieved a final injection interval of \u226512\u00a0weeks. Intraretinal fluid (IRF) significantly decreased (p = 0.0078), and chronic cystoid changes were associated with limited CST reduction (p = 0.016). No treatment-related adverse events were reported. Faricimab demonstrated favorable anatomical outcomes and extended injection intervals over two years in a real-world setting, despite the omission of a loading phase in most cases. These findings support its practical utility of faricimab for DME management in Japan.",

    "abstract": "<i>Paeonia emodi</i> has long been used in folk medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including diabetes, skin disorders, dropsy, cuts, wounds, ulcers, fever, and blood disorders, etc., which are generally categorized under the complications of diabetes mellitus. Various species of this genus have also been verified to possess strong anti-diabetic activity. In this context, the current study was designed to investigate the antidiabetic potential to confirm the purported traditional use of <i>P.\u2009emodi</i> . Different solvent fractions of <i>P.\u2009emodi,</i> i.e., crude methanolic extract (Pe.Cr), n-hexane (Pe.Hex), chloroform (Pe.Chf), ethyl acetate (Pe.EtAc), butanol (Pe.Bt) and aqueous (Pe.Aq) were used for in\u00a0vitro studies against \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1- amylase, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) using a spectrophotometer and microplate reader. Among all fractions, Pe.Bt had the most prominent activity and was subjected to GC-MS analysis, in\u00a0vivo anti-diabetic, pancreas protective, and hepatoprotective studies in alloxan-induced diabetes rats. The animals administered with alloxan (except group1) having FBGL higher than 220\u2009mg/dL were selected and placed in different groups. The first group, which served as a normal control, received normal saline. The second group received a 5% tween-80 suspension, which served as diabetic control. The 3rd, 4th and 5th groups were administered Pe.Bt at the doses of 150, 300, and 500\u2009mg/kg body weight, respectively, through oral gavage. Group six received metformin 50\u2009mg/kg and served as the standard group. Fasting Blood glucose level (FBGL) was checked for 21\u2009days. Liver function tests, insulin level, hepatoprotection, and pancreas protection study were investigated. The \u03b1-glucosidase was inhibited effectively by Pe.Bt with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 626\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The antioxidant activities also substantiated the excellent inhibitory potential of Pe.Bt. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of Pe.Bt against DPPH and ABTS was figured out to be 77 and 139\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively, which was relatively comparable with ascorbic acid. Similarly, Pe.Bt was found active against PTP-1B and showed a moderate effect against DPP4 with IC<sub>50</sub> of 45.13 and 92.45, respectively. In the time frame of 21\u2009days, the metformin and Pe.Bt significantly decreased FBGL on the 21st day to 108 and 96\u2009mg/dL, respectively. Similarly, rats treated with Pe.Bt (500\u2009mg/kg) significantly lowered the level of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased total protein level (TP) in comparison with the diabetic control group. The histopathological study revealed that rats treated with Pe.Bt (500\u2009mg/kg) have a remarkable ameliorative effect on liver and pancreas histological architecture as compared to the diabetic control group. The findings of the current investigations indicated that Pe.Bt possesses strong anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant properties and alleviates alloxan-induced pancreatic damage in diabetic rats.",

    "abstract": "<i>Nigella sativa</i> (black cumin seed) has traditionally been valued for its medicinal properties. This study explored its potential in addressing obesity-related conditions by assessing its anti-adipogenic and lipid-lowering effects. Black cumin seed extract showed high phenolic (35.48\u2009mg GAE/g DW) and flavonoid (39.51\u2009mg QE/g DW) contents with excellent standard curve linearity (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>\u2009>\u20090.99). FTIR confirmed thymoquinone-related functional groups, and GC-MS revealed 23 fatty acids, predominantly methyl eicosatrienoate (69.29%), methyl 11,14,17-eicosatrienoate (25.2%), and methyl linoleate (4.05%). These results indicate a rich phytochemical and fatty acid profile. In\u00a0vitro, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with a methanolic black cumin seed extract (BSE). Oil red O staining revealed a significant reduction in lipid accumulation, while cell viability assays confirmed no cytotoxicity. Gene expression analysis demonstrated a marked downregulation of key adipogenic transcription factors, including C/EBP\u03b1, C/EBP\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3, following BSE treatment. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) further evaluated its effects in humans. Participants in the test group consumed 5\u2009g of black cumin seed powder daily for 8\u2009weeks, while the control group received no supplementation. Appetite levels were monitored using the Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (CNAQ), with reliability ensured through Cronbach's alpha validation. Serum lipid profiles, including triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC), were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results indicated that the black cumin seed group exhibited statistically significant reductions in TG, LDL-C, and TC levels, alongside an increase in HDL-C, while the control group showed no notable reductions. Our findings suggest that black cumin seed may offer potential anti-adipogenic and lipid-lowering benefits, contributing to obesity management.",

    "abstract": "Metformin, a first-line agent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, is widely favored for its efficacy and safety profile; however, under conditions of impaired renal function, it can lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), a rare but life-threatening complication. The diagnosis requires careful exclusion of other causes of lactic acidosis, such as sepsis or hypoperfusion, which can mimic MALA. We present a case of an 88-year-old female with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III who developed severe lactic acidosis and encephalopathy in the setting of acute kidney injury and recent infection. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support. Emergent dialysis resulted in significant clinical and biochemical improvement, supporting a diagnosis of MALA. This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of MALA, particularly in vulnerable populations with evolving renal dysfunction. We present the pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and management strategies for MALA. The timely initiation of renal replacement therapy remains critical for reversing metabolic derangements and improving outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota may play a significant role in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), particularly during childhood, when the immune and metabolic systems are still maturing. This systematic review aims to synthesize recent findings on the composition, diversity, and functional characteristics of gut microbiota in children with T1DM. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2019 and July 2025. Eligible studies included observational studies examining the gut microbiota in children with T1DM using validated sequencing methods. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for microbial composition, diversity, and associated immune and metabolic alterations. Most studies reported reduced microbial diversity and depletion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Roseburia</i>, in T1DM children. An increased abundance of pro-inflammatory genera, including <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Dorea</i>, was frequently observed. Several studies have also identified elevated levels of gut permeability markers, such as zonulin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting compromised intestinal barrier function. Notably, while some studies reported decreased abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i> in T1DM, one study observed its increased abundance, indicating regional or methodological variability. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by reduced diversity, loss of beneficial microbes, and increased intestinal permeability, is consistently associated with pediatric T1DM. However, the heterogeneity of specific taxa highlights the need for standardized longitudinal research. Understanding gut microbial alterations may provide novel opportunities for early intervention and disease modulation in at-risk children.",

    "abstract": "Smoking induces oxidative stress and inflammation, which can impair insulin function and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Understanding this modifiable risk factor across diverse demographic and socioeconomic groups is essential for targeted public health interventions. To assess the relationship between current smoking and self-reported diabetes and to analyze how this association varies across demographics and socioeconomic characteristics.\u00a0 Methodology:\u00a0This retrospective study used data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary variables were smoking status and self-reported diabetes. Control variables included age, gender, race, education, and income. Data was extracted using the BRFSS Web-Enabled Analysis Tool. Cross-tabulations were performed for each variable, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \u00a0A total of 408,857 respondents across all U.S. locations aged 18 years and older were recorded; among these, 7,028 (14.1%) current smokers reported having diabetes, while 49,652 (13.8%) non-smokers reported having diabetes. The likelihood of diabetes among current smokers was slightly higher but statistically non-significant (OR = 1.025, 95% CI: 0.997-1.053). Highest odds were observed in smokers aged 65+ (n = 2,522, 20.7%), female individuals (n = 3,603, 14.7%), non-Hispanic others (n = 1,381, 16%), and those with advanced education (n = 3,472, 13.4%).

Therefore, the diabetes likelihood with smoking varies by age, sex, race, income, and education. While the overall association between smoking and diabetes was\u00a0statistically insignificant, notable differences were found among demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Further prospective studies are recommended to explore these in depth.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity is an emerging public health challenge in India due to rapid industrialization, urbanization and an aging population. Multimorbidity often impacts occupational outcomes, including work-related stress, job loss, absenteeism, and reduced years of service. Odisha, an eastern state of India, is a major mining state with a large workforce exposed to occupational physical and mental stress, and toxic waste. We determined prevalence of multimorbidity and assessed its correlates among mining workers in the Odisha, India. Additionally, we assessed the most common patterns of chronic conditions in this group. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 425 mining workers aged \u226518\u202fyears in Sukinda, Odisha, from January to July 2022. Participants were recruited using systematic random sampling. A pre-validated multimorbidity Assessment Questionnaire for Primary Care was used for face to face interviews following standardized protocols. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between multimorbidity and socio-demographic characteristics. A matrix analysis identified common dyads and triads of chronic conditions. The overall prevalence of multimorbidity was 37.41%. The most common dyad was acid peptic disease + chronic backache (10.06%), while the most frequent triad was acid peptic disease + chronic backache + chronic chest pain (1.89%). Irregular exercise [AOR: 4.66 (95% CI: 1.74-12.49)], and longer service in the mining industry (31-40\u202fyears) [AOR: 8.05 (95% CI: 1.91-33.86)] were significantly associated with multimorbidity. The high prevalence of multimorbidity among mining workers highlights the urgent need for workplace health policies and/or interventions prioritizing ergonomic improvements, chronic disease management, and routine health screenings.",

    "abstract": "Poor post-amputation healing delays prosthetic fitting, adversely affecting mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular health. Current residual limb assessments are subjective and lack standardized guidelines, emphasizing the need for objective biomarkers to improve healing and prosthesis readiness assessments. This review aimed to identify predictive, diagnostic, and indicative chemical biomarkers of healing of the tissues and structures found in the residual limbs of adults with amputation. This scoping review followed Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches using the terms \"biomarkers,\" \"wound healing,\" and \"amputation\" were performed across Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, PubMed, and CINAHL databases. Inclusion criteria were: 1) References to chemical biomarkers and healing; 2) Residuum tissue healing; 3) Repeatable methodology with ethical approval. Included articles were evaluated for quality of evidence (QualSyst tool) and level of evidence (JBI classification). Sources were categorized by study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or bench research), wound (diabetic, amputation, other), and model (human, murine, other) type. Chemical biomarkers repeated across study categories, and quantification methods were reported on. From 3,306 titles and abstracts screened, 646 underwent full-text review, and 203 met the criteria for data extraction, with 76% classified as strong quality. 38 chemical biomarkers were identified across 4 to 50 sources, with interleukins (predictive, indicative, and diagnostic) and HbA1c (predictive) most prevalent, appearing in 50 and 48 sources, respectively. Other biomarkers included predictive blood markers (e.g., cholesterol, white blood cell counts), indicative growth factors, bacteria presence (predictive), proteins (predictive, indicative, and diagnostic, e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and cellular markers (indicative and diagnostic, e.g., Ki-67, alpha-smooth muscle actin [\u03b1-SMA]). Predictive biomarkers identify comorbidities that may hinder healing, aiding in pre-amputation risk assessment for poor recovery. Indicative biomarkers monitor key biological healing processes, such as angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), wound contraction, and inflammation. Diagnostic biomarkers provide direct insights into tissue composition and cellular-level healing. Integrating these biomarkers into post-amputation assessments enables continuous monitoring of the healing process while accounting for comorbidities, enhancing the objectivity of post-surgical healing management and ensuring more effective, personalized rehabilitation strategies.",

A retrospective analysis of 344 patients diagnosed with DFU identified key clinical and laboratory variables associated with outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration analyses assessed model validity. MDRB infections were linked to longer hospitalization, lower hemoglobin, higher hs-CRP, and higher osteoporosis prevalence. Significant risk factors included prolonged hospitalization, osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, prior antimicrobial use, and respiratory rate. <i>PSA</i> infections correlated with myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease, while no significant risk factors were identified for <i>MRSA</i>. External validation showed poor discriminatory ability (AUC: 0.501 for MDRB, 0.505 for <i>PSA</i>, 0.569 for <i>MRSA</i>) and calibration performance, indicating poor generalizability of existing models in our cohort. MDRB infections in DFUs are associated with specific clinical characteristics and risk factors.
